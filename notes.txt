What is React Native?
"Learn once, write everywhere"
- Writes in Swift and Android
- Build real mobile apps by using JavaScript and React (Native)
What a React Native App is and is Not
 - not building a web app running on mobile phone
 - not building web app hosted by WebView in Native App (e.g. Ionic)
 - is building JS + React Native App, Complied to Native Code
    - All UI is complied to Native code
    - not styling with CSS is not supported
    - not typical HTML because it is not supported
    - React Native doesn't work with the normal DOM and CSS
    - It doesn't even work with the same JavaScript that supports the browser
    - All of that is given to you by React Native
    - instead of DOM, h1 you can use components

Build out workout app
- similar to strong lift
- Built with React Native app
- one code base
- What we will use
    1. 5x5 Workout App - modeling it after StrongLift
        - keep track of workout
        - keep history of workout
    2. React Native Web
        - at the end a website, iOS, and Android app
    3. Mobx - for state management
    4. Typescript - as a programming language
    5. React Navigation - to change pages in the app and the website
    6. React Hooks for the entire thing
    7. Async - will using all frontend for this so we will be using Async Storage
        or Local Storage on the phone that way can persistent the workout data as
        the user uses the app or uses the website and doesn't lose it after they come
        back to it
